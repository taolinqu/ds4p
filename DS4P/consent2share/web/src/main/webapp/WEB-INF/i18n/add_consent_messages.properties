Substance_abuse_information_sensitivity_text=Substance abuse is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods neither approved nor advised by medical professionals. Substance abuse/drug abuse is not limited to mood-altering or psycho-active drugs. If an activity is performed using the objects against the rules and policies of the matter (as in steroids for performance enhancement in sports), it is also called substance abuse. Therefore, mood-altering and psychoactive substances are not the only types of drugs abused. Using illicit drugs \u2013 narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, cannabis, even glues and paints, are also considered to be classified as drug/substance abuse.
Genetic_disease_information_sensitivity_text=A genetic disorder is an illness caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome, especially a condition that is present from birth (congenital). Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. Genetic disorders are heritable, and are passed down from the parents' genes. Other defects may be caused by new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be heritable if it occurs in the gene line. The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people.
HIV/AIDS_information_sensitivity_text=Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems.
Psychiatry_information_sensitivity_text=A mental disorder or psychiatric disorder is a psychological pattern or anomaly, potentially reflected in behavior, that is generally associated with distress or disability, and which is not considered part of normal development in a person's culture. Mental disorders are generally defined by a combination of how a person feels, acts, thinks or perceives. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain or rest of the nervous system, often in a social context. 
Sexual_assault,_abuse,_or_domestic_violence_information_sensitivity_text=Sexual assault is any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching of a person who has not consented. This includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration), inappropriate touching, forced kissing, child sexual abuse, or the torture of the victim in a sexual manner.Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, dating abuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV), is a pattern of behavior which involves the abuse by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage, cohabitation, dating or within the family. Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects, battery), or threats thereof; sexual abuse; emotional abuse; controlling or domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect); and economic deprivation.
Sexuality_and_reproductive_health_information_sensitivity_text=Human sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Human sexuality can also refer to the way someone is sexually attracted to another person \u2013 which is determined by their sexual orientation \u2013 whether it is to the opposite sex (heterosexuality), to the same sex (homosexuality), having both these tendencies (bisexuality), to all gender identities (pansexuality or bisexuality), or not being attracted to anyone in a sexual manner (asexuality). Human sexuality impacts cultural, political, legal, and philosophical aspects of life. It can refer to issues of morality, ethics, theology, spirituality, or religion. Some cultures have been described as sexually repressive. Within the framework of the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, reproductive health, or sexual health/hygiene, addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life. Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.
Sexually_transmitted_disease_information_sensitivity_text= Sexually transmitted diseases (STD), also referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STI) and venereal diseases (VD), are illnesses that have a significant probability of transmission between humans by means of human sexual behavior, including vaginal intercourse, oral sex, and anal sex. While in the past, these illnesses have mostly been referred to as STDs or VD, in recent years the term sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been preferred, as it has a broader range of meaning; a person may be infected, and may potentially infect others, without having a disease. Some STIs can also be transmitted via the use of IV drug needles after its use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or breastfeeding. Sexually transmitted infections have been well known for hundreds of years, and venereology is the branch of medicine that studies these diseases. 
Summarization_of_Episode_Note_text=The Summarization of Episode Note is a core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic, and clinical information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare encounters. It provides a means for one healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another practitioner, system, or setting to support the continuity of care. The primary use case for the Summarization of Episode Note is to provide a snapshot in time containing the pertinent clinical, demographic, and administrative data for a specific patient
Consultation_Note_text=A consultation visit is defined by the evaluation and management guidelines for a consultation established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). According to those guidelines, a Consultation Note must be generated as a result of a physician or nonphysician practitioner's (NPP) request for an opinion or advice from another physician or NPP. Consultations must involve face-to-face time with the patient or fall under guidelines for telemedicine visits. A Consultation Note must be provided to the referring physician or NPP and must include the reason for the referral, history of present illness, physical examination, and decision-making component (Assessment and Plan). An NPP is defined as any licensed medical professional as recognized by the state in which the professional practices, including, but not limited to, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, social workers, registered dietitians, physical therapists, and speech therapists.
Diagnostic_Imaging_Report_text=A Diagnostic Imaging Report (DIR) is a document that contains a consulting specialist\u2019s interpretation of image data. It conveys the interpretation to the referring (ordering) physician and becomes part of the patient\u2019s medical record. It is for use in Radiology, Endoscopy, Cardiology, and other imaging specialties.
Discharge_Summary_text=The Discharge Summary is a document that is a synopsis of a patient's admission to a hospital; it provides pertinent information for the continuation of care following discharge. The Joint Commission requires the following information to be included in the Discharge Summary\: \u0085\u2022\tThe reason for hospitalization \u0085 \u2022\tThe procedures performed \u0085 \u2022\tThe care, treatment, and services provided \u0085\u2022\tThe patient \u2019s condition and disposition at discharge \u0085\u2022\tInformation provided to the patient and family \u0085\u2022\tProvisions for follow-up care
History_and_Physical_Note_text=A History and Physical (H&P) Note is a medical report that documents the current and past conditions of the patient. It contains essential information that helps determine an individual's health status. The first portion of the report is a current collection of organized information unique to an individual, typically supplied by the patient or their caregiver, about the current medical problem or the reason for the patient encounter. This information is followed by a description of any past or ongoing medical issues, including current medications and allergies. Information is also obtained about the patient's lifestyle, habits, and diseases among family members. The next portion of the report contains information obtained by physically examining the patient and gathering diagnostic information in the form of laboratory tests, imaging, or other diagnostic procedures. The report ends with the clinician's assessment of the patient's situation and the intended plan to address those issues. A History and Physical Examination is required upon hospital admission as well as before operative procedures. An initial evaluation in an ambulatory setting is often documented in the form of an H&P Note.
Surgical_Operation_Note_text=The Surgical Operation Note is a frequently used type of procedure note with specific requirements set forth by regulatory agencies. The Surgical Operation Note is created immediately following a surgical procedure and records the pre- and post-surgical diagnosis, pertinent events of the procedure, as well as the condition of the patient following the procedure. The report should be sufficiently detailed to support the diagnoses, justify the treatment, document the course of the procedure, and provide continuity of care.
Procedure_Note_text=Procedure Note is a broad term that encompasses many specific types of non-operative procedures including interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, gastrointestinal endoscopy, osteopathic manipulation, and many other specialty fields. Procedure Notes are documents that are differentiated from Operative Notes in that the procedures documented do not involve incision or excision as the primary act. The Procedure Note is created immediately following a non-operative procedure and records the indications for the procedure and, when applicable, post-procedure diagnosis, pertinent events of the procedure, and the patient\u2019s tolerance of the procedure. The document should be sufficiently detailed to justify the procedure, describe the course of the procedure, and provide continuity of care.
Progress_Note_text=A Progress Note documents a patient\u2019s clinical status during a hospitalization or outpatient visit; thus, it is associated with an encounter. Taber\u2019s medical dictionary defines a Progress Note as \u201CAn ongoing record of a patient's illness and treatment. Physicians, nurses, consultants, and therapists record their notes concerning the progress or lack of progress made by the patient between the time of the previous note and the most recent note.\u201D Mosby\u2019s medical dictionary defines a Progress Note as \u201CNotes made by a nurse, physician, social worker, physical therapist, and other health care professionals that describe the patient's condition and the treatment given or planned.\u201D

It may include visits, appointments, as well as non-face-to-face interactions. It is also a contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment. This section may contain all encounters for the time period being summarized, but should include notable encounters.
Family_History_text=This information contains data defining the patient\u2019s genetic relatives in terms of possible or relevant health risk factors that have a potential impact on the patient\u2019s healthcare risk profile.
Findings_text=This information contains the main narrative body of the report. While not an absolute requirement for transformed DICOM SR reports, it is suggested that Diagnostic Imaging Reports authored in CDA follow Term Info guidelines31 for the codes in the various observations and procedures recorded in this section.
Functional_Status_text=The Functional Status section describes the patient\u2019s physical state, status of functioning, and environmental status at the time the document was created.The patient's functional status may be expressed as a problem or as a result observation. A functional or cognitive status problem observation describes a patient\u2019s problem, symptoms or condition. A functional or cognitive status result observation may include observations resulting from an assessment scale, evaluation or question and answer assessment. Any deviation from normal function displayed by the patient and recorded in the record should be included. Of particular interest are those limitations that would interfere with self-care or the medical therapeutic process in any way. In addition, a note of normal function, an improvement, or a change in functioning status may be included.
History_of_Past_Illness_text=This section describes the history related to the patient\u2019s past complaints, problems, or diagnoses. It records these details up until, and possibly pertinent to, the patient\u2019s current complaint or reason for seeking medical care.
Hospital_Admission_Diagnosis_text=The Hospital Admitting Diagnosis section contains a narrative description of the primary reason for admission to a hospital facility. The section includes an optional entry to record patient conditions.
Immunizations_text=The Immunizations section defines a patient's current immunization status and pertinent immunization history. The primary use case for the Immunization section is to enable communication of a patient's immunization status. 
Medications_text=This information defines a patient's current medications and pertinent medication history. At a minimum, the currently active medications are to be listed, with an entire medication history as an option. This information may also include a patient's prescription and dispense history.
Plan_of_Care_text=This information contains data that defines pending orders, interventions, encounters, services, and procedures for the patient. It is limited to prospective, unfulfilled, or incomplete orders and requests only. All active, incomplete, or pending orders, appointments, referrals, procedures, services, or any other pending event of clinical significance to the current care of the patient should be listed unless constrained due to privacy issues. The plan may also contain information about ongoing care of the patient and information regarding goals and clinical reminders. Clinical reminders are placed here to provide prompts for disease prevention and management, patient safety, and health-care quality improvements, including widely accepted performance measures. The plan may also indicate that patient education will be provided.
Problem_text=This information lists and describes all relevant clinical problems at the time the document is generated. At a minimum, all pertinent current and historical problems should be listed.
Procedure_Description_text=This information records the particulars of the procedure and may include procedure site preparation, surgical site preparation, pertinent details related to sedation/anesthesia, pertinent details related to measurements and markings, procedure times, medications administered, estimated blood loss, specimens removed, implants, instrumentation, sponge counts, tissue manipulation, wound closure, sutures used, vital signs and other monitoring data. Local practice often identifies the level and type of detail required based on the procedure or specialty.
Results_text=This information contains the results of observations generated by laboratories, imaging procedures, and other procedures. The scope includes observations such as hematology, chemistry, serology, virology, toxicology, microbiology, plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine, pathology, and procedure observations. The section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or relevant trends, and could contain all results for the period of time being documented. Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory. Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure, such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of a cardiac echocardiogram. Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
Social_History_text=This information contains data defining the patient\u2019s occupational, personal (e.g. lifestyle), social, and environmental history and health risk factors, as well as administrative data such as marital status, race, ethnicity and religious affiliation. Social history can have significant influence on a patient\u2019s physical, psychological and emotional health and wellbeing so should be considered in the development of a complete record.
